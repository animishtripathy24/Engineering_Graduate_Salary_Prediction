# Engineering Graduate Salary Prediction
Ever wondered what factors influence the starting salary of an engineering graduate in India? This project dives into the key elements that impact the salary of Indian engineering graduates. Our model predicts salary based on various parameters such as:

- 📚 **Academic Performance**: Marks in 10th and 12th grades
- 🏫 **College Tier**: The prestige of the institution
- 📝 **Subject Marks**: Scores in different subjects
- 🎓 **Overall GPA**: Grade Point Average
- 🔍 **Logical Reasoning Skills**: Assessments of logical abilities
- 📅 **Year of Graduation**

This repository contains a project that aims to predict the salary of engineering graduates based on various features. We use two different machine learning models: Linear Regression and XGBoost.
## Introduction

Predicting the salary of engineering graduates is crucial for both students and educational institutions. This project uses two machine learning models to make these predictions:
1. **Linear Regression**: A simple, yet effective model that finds a linear relationship between the features and the target variable (salary).
2. **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient boosting algorithm that often outperforms other models in terms of prediction accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features of engineering graduates, including their academic performance, specialization, and other demographic information. The target variable is the salary.

## Models

### Linear Regression
Linear Regression is used to find the linear relationship between the features and the target variable. It is easy to implement and interpret, making it a good baseline model for regression problems.

### XGBoost
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an advanced implementation of gradient boosting that is highly efficient and scalable. It often provides better performance compared to simpler models due to its ability to capture complex patterns in the data.

## Results

The performance of each model is measured using the R-squared (R²) score. This score indicates how well the model's predictions match the actual values.
